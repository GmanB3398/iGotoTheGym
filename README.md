A Final Project for QAC 307

I decided to focus on the impact of exercise on smartphone use in myself. I realized that I am constantly on my phone and use it whenever I am bored or nervous. I also independently took on the hypothesis that exercise will reduce general boredness/nervousness. Through the synthesis of these two concepts, I came up with this experiment. I knew that the amount of free time I had in a day would be an important factor, so I split the weekdays into 3 groups: Monday/Wednesday, Tuesday/Thursday, and the Weekend. This became my blocking variable. I hypothesized that I would be unable to reject the null hypothesis that exercise influences pickups in myself. I found that there is a small effect, but with many caveats. This repository is my analysis, write up, and presentation that I submitted and for QAC 307: Experimental Design and Causal Inference.
